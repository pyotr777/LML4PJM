Installation of LML_DA as a daemon

LML_DA can be installed as a daemon triggering a data collection in a given interval.
Instead of letting every client call the entire data collection workflow separately
the clients can use the data already prepared by the daemon. This also allows to
gather history data of the system load as you can rely on the daemon being active
continuously. The installation of the daemon is done by the following steps:

1) Connect a monitoring connection to your target system so that the 
.eclipsesettings directory is generated there, which contains all files needed for
the installation.

2) Switch to the folder .eclipsesettings/util/install and adapt the config file to
your needs. With that file one can configure the resource management system, the 
directory for the cached files and the installation path for the LML_DA daemon files.

3) Call the script installCrontab.pl by running
> perl installCrontab.pl

At the end of this install process it is summarized how to complete the installation.
The above script generates a script, which calls LML_DA with the required parameters.
Another script is generated, which can be run as daemon on its own, which calls the
LML_DA script in an endless loop in a given interval. Finally, a crontab entry, which
can call the LML_DA script is created, which can be added to the crontab configuration
instead of running the daemon script. Adding the crontab entry or running the daemon
script need to be done manually.
