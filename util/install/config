# Configuration file for the installation of LML_DA into a crontab

# The values will be evaluated by the install script via the PERl eval function.
# The variable $hostname will be replaced with the actual hostname of the system.
# No SHELL environment variables are used. Thus, no variable except the $hostname
# variable should be used in this configuration.

# A hint for the RMS type of the monitored system, if this hint is omitted, 
# the driver tries to determine the target system on its own.
# Use undef for automaic detection of the target system.

# Directory path where to install LML_DA. Per default ("") no LML_DA files are moved at
# all. All files needed are already available. Optionally, another directory can
# be configured here, where the LML_DA installation is placed into. E.g. with
# installdir = "/usr/bin/lmlda" all required installation files are copied to that
# directory. The daemon scripts are adapted to that path, too.
# The directory configured here must exist. It is not created by the installation script.
